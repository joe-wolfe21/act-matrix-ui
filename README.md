# The ACT Matrix

The ACT Matrix is designed to improve psychological flexibility over time. It was
created by Kevin Polk, founder of the [ACT Matrix Academy](https://www.theactmatrixacademy.com/). This static site was built as a quick POC to show how the ACT Matrix could be supported within a web app (which is now being developed [here](https://github.com/joe-wolfe21/act-matrix)). Built for Tina Long.

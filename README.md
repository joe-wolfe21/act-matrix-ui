# The ACT Matrix

The ACT Matrix is designed to improve psychological flexibility over time. It was
created by Kevin Polk, founder of the [ACT Matrix Academy](https://www.theactmatrixacademy.com/). This provides a way to easily complete the ACT matrix while on the go. It's purely for self use and currently **no data is saved**.
